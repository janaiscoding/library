<h1>Learned during this project</h1>

- In this project, I understood how to create an object constructor, access and iterate objects</br>
 inside an array and manipulate the objects inside the array after they have been declared. </br>
- I also gained a better understanding of event listeners & DOM Manipulation with Objects. </br>
- Form Validation Constraints and Preventing default on submit button. </br>

Step 2 of the project: Refactor using classes: 

- Initially I was stuck on this refactoring for a while, until I read and reread how classes work a bunch of times and finally understood how I can work with the arrays and objects within a class.
- After it clicked, all I had to do was rewrite the functions so that I call and return the correct parameters.
